#Use cases for cv2 module
1. Create an image using cv2. So I made logo of <b>opencv</b> using cv2.
2. Make a collage of images. So, I took an image has written <b>HEALTH</b>, one has written <b>IS</b>, and another has written <b>WEALTH</b>. I made collage of them to form a quote--
<h3><i>Health is Wealth</i></h3>
